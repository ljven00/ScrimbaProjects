# Password Generator


### Description
As the name suggest, **Password Generator** is simple 
page that provides an interface for someone to generate strong passwords. 
Each time we click to generate password, two passwords are printed on the screen.


### Project Info
I build the page using **HTML** **Vanilla CSS** and **JavaScript**. I learned a few things building this website, though at that time I was not familiar with any css prepocessor or JavaScript library or framework. I managed to grasp some important features like:

- Semantic html
- CSS variables
- Grid
- Flexbox
- 2D transform
- Animations
- DOM manipulation
- Function
- Event & Event Listener

Lastly, I gained some more practice using the version control system **GIT** and **GitHub** repository.

### Usage
There are instructions on the page on how to use
the application. There is a number range where 
you will need to choose the length of the 
passwords to be generated, and the minimun length is _15_. Once you do that you 
the next step is to click on the **Go!** button, 
and the passwords will be generated.

Furthermore, you have the option to copy each 
password to your clipboard by simply clicking them. Lastly, if you don't provide a length, the minimum length will be used.
